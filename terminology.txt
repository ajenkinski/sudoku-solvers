I want to document some terminology to use for aspects of sudoku
puzzles, solutions and strategies.  I've found this terminology on various
websites.  There doesn't seem to be a generally agreed upon
terminology, so I'm just documenting whatever stuck with me.

== Terminology about puzzle aspects ==

* I'll a sudoku puzzle a "puzzle"

* Rows and columns are labeled 1 through 9.

* Each 3x3 section is called a box.  Boxes are also labeled 1 through
  9 in row major order.

* A collection of 9 cells (a row, column, or 3x3 box) is called a
  "unit". 

* The intersection of a row and column is a "cell".

* The other cells in a unit are that cell's "peers".  More
  generally, the union of all the other cells in the units a cell
  belongs to are its peers.


== Terminology about solving strategy ==

* cells can be assigned or unassigned

* An unassigned cell has a list of "possibilities" associated with it,
  which are the values which can be assigned to it without violating
  any constraints.

=== Patterns ===

* A "forced move" refers to an unassigned cell with only one
  possibility.  This single possibility can be immediately assigned to
  the cell.

* A "pin" is a cell which is the only cell in a unit which can contain
  a particular value.  This means that value can be assigned
  immediately to the cell.

* "Naked set": If n unassigned cells in a unit collectively contain
  exactly n possibilities, then those possibilities can be removed
  from any other cells in that unit.  A "simple naked set" is a naked
  set where each of the n cells contains exactly the same set of n
  possibilities.  This deserves special mention simply because it's
  easier to spot than naked sets in general.

* "Hidden set": the inverse of naked sets.  If n values are
  collectively contained in only n cells in a unit, then any other
  values can be removed from the possibilities of those n cells.  For
  example, if two cells in a unit contain the possibilities <12> and
  <123>, and no other cells in that unit contain 1 or 2, then those
  two cells must contain one and 2, so the 3 can be removed from the
  possibilities list of the second cell.  A "simple hidden set" is to
  a "hidden set" what a "simple naked set" is to a "naked set".

* "Remote naked pairs": If two cells A and B in a unit have the same
  two possibilities XY, they form a "naked pair"; one will be X and
  the other Y.  If cell B also forms a naked pair in another unit
  with cell C, then A and C are "complementary pairs"; whatever A
  is, C must be the same.  If C in turn forms a naked pair with D in
  yet another block, then A and D form a "remote naked pair"; if A is
  X, D must be Y, and vice versa.  Thus, any cell that is a peer of
  both A and D cannot contain X or Y! (Copied from the Sudoku Susser
  manual).
